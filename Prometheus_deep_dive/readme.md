## Section 1 - Introduction to Prometheus 

### High-level use cases
- Metric collection about your systems and applications in one place
- Visualization with dashboards and graphs of the health of your systems
- Alerting when something is broken 

### Prometheus Architecture 
The two most basic components of a Prometheus system are
- Prometheus server: A central server that gathers metrics and makes them available 
- Exporters: Agents that expose data about systems and applications for collection by the Prometheus server

Prometheus Pull Model
- Prometheus server pulls metric data from exporters - agents do not push data to the Prometheus server
